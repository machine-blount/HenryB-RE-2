# Exploring CNC invention 
***smaller sprint’s I had done throughout my RE(Resident Expert)***

##RE Timeline 
While creating anything for my resident expert, there is a point where a project might have parts that need to be cut on the shapebook, then the laser cutter, then post processed to be completed. I found that this can become disorienting for some projects so I created a timeline that act similarly to a flow chart where a project or sprint is broken down into individual tasks that are laid out in order.

What's special about this method of project structuring for me, is that any point where the main timeline branches means that the branched task can be done separate to a main task and doesn't rely on it until later in the process. For example preparing the CAM files and preparing the material to be cut, rather than preparing the CAM files and measuring the material since you would need to measure the material first in order to create the CAM files.

##Compliant Mechanisms
After finding some information online about compliant mechanisms, I was immediately fascinated and wanted to experiment on my own. I won't explain the working principles of compliant mechanisms in depth, but the main idea is to design mechanisms that bend. 

On our solar car team it's a common annoyance that doing any maintenance on the batteries requires an isolated tool, since these can be expensive. We opted to wrap up everything in kapton tape and double check with a multimeter to make sure it was properly isolated. I figured in a scenario like this, a simple plastic part that we could stock up on multiple of could be beneficial to any sort of in race maintenance. 

This was a surprisingly difficult exercise in thinking about how to convert hinged mechanisms into ones that bend instead and can be made from 1 solid part. I remember breaking down my crimper into basic shapes as a way to get an idea on which parts need to move.

The above are some designs that I had CNC milled out of HDPE I experimented with different thicknesses and shapes but ultimately a design as simple as the ones above showed the best signs of working. However they all had a difficult time closing and the design would still need to be further improved, possibly with a different material. 

##Plotted Contact Card

During one of our highschool symposiums where we shared some artifacts from projects throughout the year, I wanted to demonstrate how our Shapeoko worked without the sawdust and loud noise inside the building. The way around this for me was to use my Shapeoko like a pen plotter to make contact cards for anyone that passed by my table. 

I did this by attaching a cut in half pencil inside the shapeoko’s collet and creating a very thin model of my contact card which I created using Fusion. The first few tries did not work but I was able to get everything up and running in only around 30-45 minutes which was just in time for the symposium.

##Tealight Holder
As a part of an Etsy competition that our high school had held to see who could make the most money by creating a product and advertising it, I created an acrylic tealight. My original design had actually failed to work out right before the competition started so I had to redesign the simple tealight. 

The final design is only made up of 3 acrylic layers held together by 3D printed supports.

To document smaller sprints similar to these, I created a blog website using glitch. I don't ever work with web based programming so it has been a really exciting experience making a tailored website for my content. You can visit it here - [click me](https://utopian-guttural-skull.glitch.me/)
